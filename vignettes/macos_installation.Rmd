NOTE: **THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ONLY FOR M1 MACS**, please use the [installation instructions](installation.html) if you do not have an M1 Mac

How to check if you have an M1 Mac:

1. Click the `About this Mac` in the drop down menu from the top left corner of the screen

2. If the popup displays `Chip Apple M1`(see image below) - you have an M1 Mac computer with all its assorted problems with R package installations and you might need the instructions below to troubleshoot installing the packages required for this workshop. However, we strongly recommend using a VM for the workshop and to try these instructions in your own time

Alternatively if you see something like this:

You shouldn't have too much grief getting the packages installed and should follow these [installation instructions.](installation.html)

## Troubleshooting installation on M1 Mac with R.4.2:

1. Do not install any packages from source - select `no` when asked.

2. Additional packages to install to load Seurat & Harmony:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("rgeos", "spatstat.core", "RcppEigen", "RcppArmadillo"))
```

3. Harmony will not install and returns an error that looks like something like this:

```
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/opt/R/arm64/gfortran/lib/gcc/aarch64-apple-darwin20.6.0/12.0.1'
ld: library not found for -lemutls_w
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make: *** [harmony.so] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package ‘harmony’
* removing ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/library/harmony’
Warning message:
In i.p(...) :
  installation of package ‘/var/folders/1k/bbv_y78s4zj0m29mb6fwj3km69dgdb/T//Rtmp9jOOMQ/file83ee3a886f7c/harmony_0.1.1.tar.gz’ had non-zero exit status
```

Solution: install [GNU Fortran compiler](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/). Following the instructions for that link in regards to Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and above):

i. Download the experimental branch of GNU Fortran (run the code below in your terminal)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
wget https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.0.1-20220312-is-darwin20-arm64.tar.xz
```

ii. This binary unpacks into /opt/R/arm64/gfortran plus a symbolic link in /opt/R/arm64/bin/gfortran. To unpack use:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
tar fxz gfortran-12.0.1-20220312-is-darwin20-arm64.tar.xz -C /
```
If this fails because you do not have permission, run it with sudo as so:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo tar fxz gfortran-12.0.1-20220312-is-darwin20-arm64.tar.xz -C /
```
It will ask for a password - this should be the same password as your user account. 

iii. Install harmony with devtools:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("immunogenomics/harmony")
```
